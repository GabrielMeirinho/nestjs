# Nest Home Test

Full-stack example:
- Backend: NestJS (Node + TypeScript)
- Frontend: Vue 3 + TypeScript
- DB: PostgreSQL
- Docker + docker-compose


For simplicity I kept frontend and backend in a single repo with nested frontend/ and backend/ folders. 
In a real project I’d likely use a monorepo tool (e.g. Rush) with shared types between FE/BE.
